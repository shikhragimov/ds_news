# What is it about
Currently I'm expert in Data Science and intersted in astronomy and graphs.
So here will be links to articles on these topics, some notebooks and example in jupyter notebooks fromat. I suppose to add new notebook (post) every week, because it seems for me reasonable.

If you have questions to answer in this format, feel free to write to me.

A warning:
A stable format for such records has not yet been determined.
